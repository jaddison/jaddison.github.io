                <p>If you&#8217;re not aware, there&#8217;s a bit of a <a href="https://unblockcanada.ca/">tussle going on with regards to internet service pricing here in Canada</a>. Given the situation, I thought I would explore other options - of which there are not very many in Canada, and fewer still here in Victoria, <span class="caps">BC</span>.</p>
<p>A like-minded friend recently switched from the local cable internet incumbent Shaw to a new local entrant by the name of <a href="https://www.juce.ca/">Juce Communications</a>. Although only recently started, he&#8217;s happy with the service and pricing - and he&#8217;s got a thing against Shaw. So, he&#8217;s advocating others move to Juce&#8230; which brings this story to&nbsp;me.</p>
<h4>Juce&nbsp;Overview</h4>
<p>Juce, based out of Victoria, <span class="caps">BC</span>, currently has two service plans: 25Mbps ($39.95/mo + taxes) and 50Mbps ($79.95/mo + taxes). No bandwidth capping. I believe they have plans to expand to cover most cable-ready regions of <span class="caps">BC</span> and&nbsp;Alberta.</p>
<p>Juce is quite upfront about their billing policies (upfront billing), transfer and installation fees in their <a href="https://www.juce.ca/"><span class="caps">FAQ</span> section on their site</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re currently with Shaw, then there is a $22 transfer fee, otherwise there is a $79 installation fee (for example, if you switched from Telus, the local <span class="caps">DSL</span> incumbent provider). Why the difference? If you&#8217;re not with Shaw already, it means you likely need to get the necessary cabling for the modem set up in your house, for one. Additionally, Shaw needs to do some &#8216;provisioning&#8217; (configuration) of modems on behalf of Juce, so having an existing Shaw account makes this easier, I&nbsp;presume.</p>
<p>I figured it was time for me to upgrade anyhow, so on June 9th I chose the 50Mbps Juce&nbsp;plan.</p>
<h4>Signing&nbsp;up</h4>
<p>The online signup process was simple enough; I really only got bogged down when choosing which modem to get. I wanted to look up some reviews of their listed compatible models - here are the options Juce&nbsp;provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will use my own modem.&nbsp;$0.00</li>
<li>Motorola <span class="caps">SB6120</span> <span class="caps">DOCSIS</span> 3.0 (Refurbished)&nbsp;$35.00</li>
<li>Motorola <span class="caps">SB6141</span> <span class="caps">DOCSIS</span> 3.0 (Motorola Refurbished)&nbsp;$49.00</li>
<li>Thomson <span class="caps">DCM475</span> <span class="caps">DOCSIS</span> 3.0 (<span class="caps">NEW</span>)&nbsp;$79.00</li>
</ul>
<p>I selected with the Motorola <span class="caps">SB6141</span> as reviews indicated it was the best compromise between cost and&nbsp;quality.</p>
<p>That same day I received a few emails: some invoicing/billing related and one with a tracking number for my modem. About two or three days later, I received the modem. On June 13th I received confirmation of my activation window which was to be on June 16th. It&#8217;s unfortunate it takes a while to do this, but from my understanding a big part of the delay rests on Shaw&#8217;s shoulders (scheduling provisioning,&nbsp;etc).</p>
<p>Both Shaw and Juce deliver services via Shaw&#8217;s &#8220;last mile&#8221; stretch of network.  If you&#8217;re like me and ordered a new/refurbished modem through Juce, then you simply need to wait for the modem to arrive (sent with a tracking number via Canada Post) and then plug it in, at which point Shaw (yes, Shaw - not Juce) needs to update the modem with a new configuration, telling it to communicate with the Juce&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>If you already have a working, compatible modem, the only thing necessary is for Shaw to update your modem&#8217;s configuration to switch to&nbsp;Juce.</p>
<p>And so the wait&nbsp;began.</p>
<h4>Activation and&nbsp;Testing</h4>
<p>On my activation date of June 16th, I plugged the modem in. In a couple of minutes, it picked up the connection and everything was running via Juce. Literally, that&#8217;s all there was to&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>However, the story doesn&#8217;t end here. Like any nerd, I load up a speed test website to test the new connection, and I get 21-22Mbps! Remember, I ordered the 50Mbps plan, so naturally I started raging and throwing my stuffed animals around. (Just kidding, I don&#8217;t have any stuffies - not in my office&nbsp;anyhow.)</p>
<p>I sent a quick &#8220;What&#8217;s going on here&#8221; email to their support team. Within minutes (awesome Juce!), I received a response explaining that the modem had been sent the wrong config. To correct things, they&#8217;d sent a request to Shaw to update the modem to the correct config - and of course, this can take a few days for whatever the same reasons were that you have to wait activate in the first place (Shaw being slow to respond, a backlog in their teams, politics,&nbsp;whatever).</p>
<p>But wait, my bad luck didn&#8217;t end there! The new modem (actually, refurbished) dropped the connection entirely. I thought it was something to do with the incorrect config file, but after unplugging it a few times, I still had no luck.  Another email to the Juce support team (at&nbsp;11:30pm)&#8230;</p>
<p>In the morning (June 17th), I got a reply from Juce saying they would send someone out to poke around for problems. The rep was courteous and apologetic on behalf of Juce - thank you! He got the modem working again, ran a speed test which showed speeds around 29Mbps - for the current 25Mbps plan, that was pretty good! He said that they &#8220;over-provision&#8221; to ensure customers get a good speed&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the modem dropped the connection again. Frustrating. At this point it was looking to be the modem itself - likely just a dud. The rep pulled another identical modem out of his bag and hooked it up - while it wasn&#8217;t provisioned (no config file yet, meaning it couldn&#8217;t provide a connection), the blinky lights showed more promise. The rep confirmed it was showing more promise than the initial modem, and said that he&#8217;d leave it in place and put in the request with Shaw to have it provisioned (and with the correct speed of 50Mbps this&nbsp;time).</p>
<p>Within two hours (still June 17th), I received an email from Juce support saying that I can plug the modem in, it will get provisioned and I can start hitting the internet over Juce&#8217;s pipes. They clarified that it would still be at the 25Mbps speed until Shaw updated the configuration - which could take a few days as mentioned previously. I ran a quick speed test and saw 29Mbps - same as the rep when he had been here - so definitely more promising a start. It hasn&#8217;t been long, but observationally I think it was a dud modem. I can&#8217;t blame Juce for that. I can credit them with timely support/response times,&nbsp;however!</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Throughout the changeover, I hadn&#8217;t cancelled my existing Shaw account. I wanted to give Juce a spin for a day or two and then cancel Shaw if things are smooth. I&#8217;d definitely recommend this approach to others considering this switch - I wouldn&#8217;t consider it as necessary if you were using your existing modem (you know it already works, after all)&nbsp;however.</p>
<p>The 25Mbps/50Mbps mixup may have been caused on either Juce&#8217;s or Shaw&#8217;s end, whether miscommunication or straight up error. Juce took care of me, however - they issued a refund of $10 to my account without question or prompting. That is more than you can say about many businesses out&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Overall, even through the difficulties I&#8217;ve encountered, I&#8217;m impressed with how Juce - a small and young company - has performed. I truly hope that they aren&#8217;t squashed by the <a href="https://cartt.ca/article/shaws-proposed-wholesale-broadband-rates-just-unreasonable-independent-isps-argue">incumbents&#8217; political moves (trying to price out &#8220;last mile&#8221; resellers)</a>. You should read that&nbsp;article.</p>
<p><strong>Edit, June 20th</strong>: My modem has been reconfigured with 50Mbps. Initial speed tests show 58Mbps down, 3.5Mbps up - solid performance overall. Although the faster speeds are nice, I doubt my usage patterns require it so I&#8217;ll likely drop down to the 25Mbps plan in a few days to save some&nbsp;cash.</p>
<h5>Notes</h5>
<p>For reference, my existing Shaw service was an old 25Mbps plan (definitely capped), which doesn&#8217;t seem to be publicly available anymore.  It was costing me $67/month + taxes - about $75/month&nbsp;total.</p>
